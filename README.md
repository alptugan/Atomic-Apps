# What are Atomic Apps?

💻 Atomic Apps are small, customized applications created using the Automator app on your Mac 🤖. These apps are designed to automate specific tasks and can be easily accessed by attaching them to the Finder window's toolbar 🚀. The best part? The Automator app is included with macOS, making it easy for anyone to create their own custom apps! 🙌
With Automator, you can run Shell commands, launch applications, run scripts, and more, allowing you to configure even the most complex tasks with ease ⚙️. Whether you're looking to streamline your workflow or just want to save time on repetitive tasks, Atomic Apps can help you work more efficiently and effectively 💪.
